# A Simple Calculator
---
A calculator widget built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The calculator is capable of chaining expressions, but by default rounds answers to at most
3 characters. CSS grid layout greatly simplified the construction of the web-app. 

This app underwent a refactor to encapsulate button functionalities between numbers, operations, the clear button and equal button.
This greatly increased the readability of the JavaScript code while elimating any chance of bugs cause by buttons performing the wrong task. 
In the long run, testing will be made much easier with more atomic functionalities too! 

Enjoy :smile:
